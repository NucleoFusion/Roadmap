## âœ¨ Real Project Ideas

| Phase | Project |
|:---|:---|
| Deep Memory | Implement a slab allocator in Zig. |
| Data Layout | Serialize/deserialize a Zig struct manually to a file. |
| Systems | Write a TCP echo server using raw syscalls (no stdlib). |
| Concurrency | Implement a lock-free ring buffer (FIFO queue) in Zig. |
| Linking/Binaries | Write a parser that reads and prints ELF section names. |
| VM | Create a bytecode interpreter for math expressions (`3 + 5 * 2`). |
| OS | Write a bootloader that prints text, then a kernel that changes colors. |
